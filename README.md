      -  **Data Cleaning and formating**
          1. Reduce the data set by deleting unnecessary/unimportant columns and removing duplicates.
          2. Change datatype
          3. Extract Product_category and Product_type from Category, Review_new from Review_id
          4. From the cleaned data set, calculated tables are derived
